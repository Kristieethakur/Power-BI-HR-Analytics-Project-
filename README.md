# Power-BI-HR-Analytics-Project-
An HR analytics project where I analyzed employee attendance data with the goal of understanding how people are working.
Here's what I did:

-Cleaned and prepped the raw data using Power Query
-Built dynamic DAX measures (CALCULATE, SWITCH, SUM) to track presence, WFH, and sick leave
-Created a dashboard with:
KPI Cards (Presence %, WFH %, Sick %)
Area charts showing daily trends
Tables for name-wise and weekday-wise breakdown

Key Insights:

Monday = highest office presence
Friday = peak for work-from-home
WFH % steadily increased over 3 months
Slight spike in sick leaves in June

This project gave me hands-on experience in building interactive dashboards, spotting behavior trends, and shaping business decisions using Power BI.
